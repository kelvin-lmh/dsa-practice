# DSA Practice 🚀

This repository is dedicated to practicing **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**

The goal is to build solid problem‑solving skills, recognize common DSA patterns, and be well‑prepared for technical interviews.

## 🎯 Learning Approach

1. Identify the **pattern** behind each problem
2. Solve the problem with optimal **time & space complexity**
3. Refactor code for clarity and readability
4. Add notes if the solution is non‑trivial

## ✨ Motivation

This repo represents my journey of becoming better at problem solving, one problem at a time.

Happy Coding! 😄
